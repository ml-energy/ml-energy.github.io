# The ML.ENERGY Initiative

This repository contains the source code for the [https://ml.energy](https://ml.energy) website.

Code was adapted from [here](https://github.com/pras75299/One-page-Corporate-Template).

## Adding Stuff

Everything is raw HTML and CSS.
For example, if you want to add a new member, just find the section for Members in `index.html`, duplicate the `div` element for an existing member, and punch in information.

## Requirements for PRs

- You should preview locally in a web browser whether it looks fine (e.g., no weird Bootstrap grid rendering) and **attach a screenshot** in the PR (just for the part of the website that changed).
- Profile images for people should be **400 x 400 pixels** (otherwise photo sizes will go all haywire when the screen is scaled down to mobile) and **no larger than 100 KB** for optimized loading latency.
